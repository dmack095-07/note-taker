  ## Description:
  I created an application to write, save, and delete notes. I used a backend application called express to create HTML and API routes. For HTML, I used GET request for /notes and  *  to return the home page(index). For the API route, I used /api/notes to GET notes and POST to save. In this assignment, I was also required to delete notes using /api/notes/:id.

  ## Installation:
  First use "npm intall" then "npm install nodemon -g".

  ## Usage:
  This application can be used to write, store, and delete notes.
